# sanictype

autocomplete for windows, written in nim

### Usage
Download it by clicking the download from zip button. Unzip it to whatever directory you want.

Next, double click on sanic.exe. A window should pop up with nothing in it. You are now good to go!

To use, start typing a word, and hit tab. Continue hitting tab to cycle through words based on frequency. If it glitches out, delete the word, and make sure to press space before rewriting it. The program uses spaces and newlines to keep track of new words. Backspacing can be weird.
